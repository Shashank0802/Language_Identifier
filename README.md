# Language Identifier

# Description
This project is designed to identify the language of a given text by leveraging basic preprocessing and feature engineering. It processes multilingual text data and uses pattern matching or statistical techniques to classify text into its respective language without relying on traditional machine learning models.

The goal is to create a lightweight, rule-based language detection system that can serve as a foundation for further enhancements.

# Key Features

Text Preprocessing: Includes text cleaning, normalization (e.g., converting to lowercase), and handling special characters.

Rule-Based Detection: Uses statistical or heuristic methods (e.g., word frequency, character n-grams) to identify the language.

Lightweight Solution: Focuses on simplicity and efficiency, avoiding computationally heavy models.

Multilingual Dataset: Utilizes a dataset (languages.csv) with text samples from various languages.
